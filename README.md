# Tabs
Ready-made script of tabs for your website

For the script to work correctly, it must be configured. 
In the "script.js" file, find the following structure: 

    let classes = {
            parentClass: '.Your class',      // Here instead of "Your class" substitute the class of the parent of your tabs
            tabClass: '.Your class',         // Here instead of "Your class" substitute the class of the tabs themselves
            tabContentClass: '.Your class'   // Here instead of "Your class" substitute the content class of the tabs
    }
    
Do not forget to put a full stop "." before the class name!
